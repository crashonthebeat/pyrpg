# PyRPG
PyRPG is a console-based text-adventure RPG Engine. This is a project I have started several times, and it's mostly just something I do for fun and learning. I've had to delete and remake it because I find something in the structure that makes it really hard to build out.

## Feature Wishlist
- Text User Interface
- Lots of Crunch (as much as I can get away with with performance considerations)
- Quest System (Multiple quests, quest tracking)
- Morrowind-Style Dialogue system (topic-based rather than response based)
- Language parsing
